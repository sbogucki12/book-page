        <div class="book-excerpt">
            <p>"The desert taught him about distance. First, the physical kindâ€”miles stretching between outposts, between bodies, between then and now. 
                Later, the kind that exists in the mind." Follow a combat veteran's journey from the streets of Ramadi to the isolation of modern America, 
                where "his generation excels at this particular paradoxâ€”physically closer than people have ever lived, yet emotionally more isolated than 
                perhaps any before them." This raw, unflinching narrative explores how "the loneliness that followed her departure was total, enveloping. 
                Not the familiar solitude he'd known most of his life, but a new, more acute variety born from having briefly known its opposite." 
                Through war memories, failed relationships, and the daily discipline that both saves and isolates him, discover how "maybe this is the war now. 
                The long, slow battle against himself. And maybe, just maybe, he is still fighting to win."</p>
