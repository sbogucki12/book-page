                    <h3 class="changelog-section">REFINEMENTS</h3>
                    
                    <h4>Narrative Consistency</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Maintained third-person perspective throughout all additions</li>
                        <li>Preserved somber, Hemingway-esque prose style with stream-of-consciousness elements</li>
                        <li>Continued emphasis on vivid sensory details and environmental descriptions</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Factual Corrections</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fixed background details about Hamburg, Pennsylvania and gifted program instead of Catholic school</li>

            <div class="changelog-entry">
                <h2 class="changelog-date">March 17, 2025</h2>
                <div class="changelog-content">
                    <p class="changelog-intro">In this revision of "The Ghosts We Carry," several profound dimensions have been added to the narrative, creating a more textured exploration of isolation in the connected age. Readers will discover:</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="changelog-section">MANUFACTURED ROLE MODELS</h3>
                    <p>The protagonist's journey is now enriched with the poignant revelation of how the absence of male guidance led him to construct his own heroes—from Special Forces soldiers to Jim Morrison. This section illuminates how a young man with an alcoholic stepfather and absent biological father creates ideals from borrowed materials, setting impossible standards that haunt his adult decisions. The consequences of these manufactured heroes echo throughout his life choices, creating patterns of self-sabotage that even his considerable self-awareness cannot disrupt.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="changelog-section">THE RACING MIND</h3>
                    <p>A striking new dimension reveals the protagonist's constantly accelerating thoughts—his mind "a perpetual motion machine that consumes energy without productive output, that generates heat without light, that exhausts without accomplishing." This internal chaos contrasts sharply with his external discipline, revealing how substances like cannabis provide not escape but focus, allowing him rare moments of mental quiet. The addition culminates in a harrowing account of mental collapse and his weeklong stay at a veterans hospital—a profound counterpoint to his carefully maintained façade of control.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="changelog-section">APRIL 7, 2003: THE DAY EVERYTHING CHANGED</h3>
                    <p>The manuscript now includes a visceral, moment-by-moment account of the missile strike that fundamentally rewired the protagonist's nervous system. This pivotal trauma is rendered in startling detail—from the screaming descent of the missile to the aftermath of destruction. The sequence illuminates how a single moment can create a permanent boundary between before and after, connecting directly to his physical reactions to aircraft sounds years later, providing crucial context for understanding his hypervigilance.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="changelog-section">BEYOND NEIGHBORS: THE WIDER WEB OF DISCONNECTION</h3>
                    <p>The theme of millennial isolation expands beyond apartment neighbors to include a rich tapestry of missed connections—Nick from the gym, Austin who served in the same unit, Juan from his college fraternity. Most compelling is the new exploration of women at the gym, where shared spaces and aligned values never translate into actual connection. These additions create a more universal portrait of contemporary loneliness, where proximity never becomes intimacy.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="changelog-section">STREAMLINED NARRATIVE</h3>
                    <p>The narrative has been refined to eliminate redundancies while preserving essential recurring elements. The strip club visits, a significant marker in the protagonist's Saturday night rituals, now appear in more focused form—allowing their significance to resonate without repetition.</p>
                    
                    <p class="changelog-conclusion">The manuscript now presents a more complete portrait of a man navigating the particular isolation of the connected age—where screens mediate relationships, where shared spaces don't create shared lives, and where the most educated generation in history remains paradoxically the most existentially alone. Through these additions, "The Ghosts We Carry" becomes not just one man's story but a profound meditation on connection, meaning, and the unresolved human need for authentic encounter in an increasingly fragmented world.</p>
