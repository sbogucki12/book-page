                    <h3 class="changelog-section">THEMATIC DEVELOPMENTS</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1. Rescuer Archetype:</strong> Introduced and developed throughout as unifying concept; connected military rescue to emotional/familial protection; positioned as preparation for fatherhood and partnership; linked Latulippe's teaching to future family protection</li>
                        <li><strong>2. Pattern of Surrender as Named Force:</strong> Transformed from implied theme to explicit antagonist; given consistent terminology throughout manuscript; positioned as the central conflict to be overcome; made breaking the Pattern the climactic achievement</li>
                        <li><strong>3. Foreshadowing of Parenthood:</strong> Added observations of parents with children; included recognition of missing continuity in millennial life; expanded discussion of future children's inheritance; positioned fatherhood as ultimate purpose reveal</li>
                        <li><strong>4. Melissa as Central Figure:</strong> Elevated from brief mention to fully developed character; positioned as Pattern-breaker and catalyst for change; made her the "immovable object" that stops the Pattern; strengthened love story as core narrative element</li>
                        <li><strong>5. Sexual Dysfunction Context:</strong> Seeded performance anxiety earlier (Part I, Part VIII); created narrative thread leading to Part XV crisis; positioned resolution with Melissa as significant healing; used as metaphor for larger mind-body disconnection</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="changelog-section">CONSISTENCY UPDATES</h3>

                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Dog References:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Added Mama and Chonk alongside Roux in later sections</li>
                        <li>Modified to "three dogs" where applicable</li>
                        <li>Updated final sections to reflect fuller household</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Timeline Clarifications:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2017 established as year of mental health crisis</li>
                        <li>Nicki relationship placed in 2017</li>
                        <li>VA hospitalization dated to 2017</li>
                        <li>Melissa relationship implied as more recent</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="changelog-section">WORD COUNT CHANGES (ESTIMATED)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Part I: +400 words</li>
                        <li>Part III: +300 words</li>
                        <li>Part VI: +500 words</li>
                        <li>Part VIII: +200 words</li>
                        <li>Part XI: +1,200 words</li>
                        <li>Part XIV: +2,500 words</li>

                        <li>Part XVI: +800 words (Pattern language)</li>
                        <li>Part XVII: +300 words</li>
                        <li><strong>Total Addition: Approximately 10,700 words</strong></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="changelog-conclusion">The addition of Part XV (Breaking Point) serves multiple purposes: creates a clear nadir before the redemptive conclusion; provides missing explanation for mental health references; completes narrative arc seeded in earlier parts; shows authentic struggle before triumph; demonstrates how rock bottom became foundation for growth; makes Melissa's healing impact more powerful by comparison. All additions maintain third-person perspective, Hemingway-influenced sparse prose, Joyce-influenced stream-of-consciousness in emotional moments, avoidance of sentimentality, integration of military/technical precision in language, self-deprecating modest charm, and unflinching honesty about failure and damage.</p>
