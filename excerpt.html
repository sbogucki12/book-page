        <h2 class="excerpt-title">ME-MOM AND POP-POP</h2>
        
        <div class="excerpt-text">
            <p>But before he manufactured heroes from books and distant observations, there were Me-Mom and Pop-pop. His maternal grandparents—though he wouldn't learn until far too late that Me-Mom was actually his mother's adopted mother—who had relocated to North Dakota on the recommendation of their Pennsylvania friend, Jeff. They'd settled three miles outside McVille, deeper into the countryside than seemed reasonable, in a small farmstead that operated by different rules than any he'd encountered.</p>

            <p>Pop-pop was mostly blind by the time the boy knew him, yet somehow remained a federal arms dealer, operating from memory and touch what others required sight to accomplish. The old man would disassemble and repair firearms in the dim light of their living room, his fingers moving with the confidence of someone who'd internalized the mechanical architecture so completely that vision became redundant. The boy would watch, mesmerized by this magical ability, by the way Pop-pop's hands could diagnose problems, identify parts, execute repairs that seemed impossible for someone who couldn't see the work.</p>

            <p>The farmstead itself felt like a time capsule, a deliberate rejection of modern acceleration. The television stayed unplugged—not broken, but irrelevant. Instead, there was conversation and the constant background of classical music from Prairie Public Radio, the sounds filling spaces that other homes packed with electronic noise. The door remained perpetually open to visitors, friends passing through at all hours, the house operating as a kind of salon where stories and ideas circulated with the same importance other families gave to scheduled programming.</p>

            <p>But the main character was always Me-Mom. Whip-smart and rail thin, she commanded the space with effortless authority. She would tell stories all night, her narratives weaving through history and memory with the skill of someone who understood that storytelling was a form of preservation. She played the organ with the same ease, music flowing from her fingers as naturally as speech. At the card table, she was merciless—beating everyone frustratingly at Rummy and Scrabble, drinking gin the entire time, never sober but never apparently drunk, maintaining that precise equilibrium that suggested the alcohol was fuel rather than impediment.</p>

            <p>Before North Dakota, before the boy knew them, Me-Mom and Pop-pop had been adventurous in ways that seemed almost mythical. Amateur pilots with their own experimental aircraft, they'd barnstormed across the country in machines they'd helped build. They'd kayaked from New York to Delaware, navigating the Delaware River and all its tributaries, carrying their lives in waterproof packs, camping on riverbanks, choosing adventure over comfort with the casual certainty of people who'd never questioned whether such choices were reasonable.</p>

            <p>Pop-pop was a war veteran, though to what extent the boy would never know because back then he didn't know the right questions to ask. The old man never volunteered the information, and the boy—still too young to understand what service meant, what it cost, what it changed—never pressed. Later, much later, after his own deployments, after Ramadi and April 7th and all the accumulated weight of combat experience, he would wish desperately for those lost conversations, for the chance to compare notes with someone who'd carried similar burdens in different wars.</p>

            <p>Instead, he read to Pop-pop from issues of Soldier of Fortune magazine, the old man listening intently to articles about special operations, about tactics and equipment and the ongoing evolution of unconventional warfare. The boy didn't understand then what he was absorbing—the romance of elite military units, the appeal of operating outside conventional structures, the mystique of warriors who moved through shadows. He just knew that Pop-pop's attention sharpened during these readings, that the blind old man could visualize scenarios from verbal descriptions, could critique tactical decisions, could offer observations that suggested depths of experience never explicitly acknowledged.</p>

            <p>The aviation magazines scattered around the farmstead became another obsession. The boy would sketch airplanes for hours, copying the clean lines of fighters and transports, trying to understand the aerodynamics that kept metal aloft, developing a fascination with flight that would persist throughout his life. Years later, working at the FAA, surrounded by the bureaucracy of aviation safety, he would sometimes remember those afternoons at his grandparents' farmstead, drawing planes while Pop-pop repaired guns and Me-Mom played Scrabble and classical music filled the spaces between conversation.</p>

            <p>When his family moved deeper into the North Dakota countryside—four or five miles from Me-Mom and Pop-pop's place—the boy would ride his bike between the two farmsteads, fighting against the constant wind gusts that characterized the prairie. He never knew that his stepfather followed him at a distance, just past his visible range, ensuring his safety while allowing him the illusion of independent adventure. The contradiction was characteristic of his stepfather—present but not intrusive, protective but not controlling, loving in ways the boy couldn't yet recognize or appreciate.</p>

            <p>Me-Mom and Pop-pop's gravel driveway stretched a quarter mile from the road to their house. Every time the boy arrived on his bike, windblown and triumphant, Me-Mom would plant an American flag—a simple gesture that inspired a patriotism that has never ceased to this day, though it's changed significantly given the divisiveness of present-day politics that he despises and thinks makes a mockery of his sacrifice and service. Back then, the flag meant something simpler, something purer—the recognition of effort, the celebration of persistence, the physical manifestation of welcome and belonging.</p>

            <p>The summer he was supposed to fly back to Pennsylvania to spend time with his sister Christine, everything changed. Me-Mom was diagnosed with cancer that spring. But she lasted all summer, in-patient at the Grand Forks hospital, her body failing but her will holding fast. She waited for his return from Pennsylvania, held on through weeks that should have taken her, refused to leave until she could see him one more time.</p>

            <p class="read-more-link" style="text-align: center; margin: 30px 0;">
                <a href="#form-container" class="button">Read the Complete Manuscript</a>
            </p>

            <p>He visited her after returning to North Dakota. Saw her in the hospital bed, the cancer having taken so much that coherence came only in fragments. The whip-smart woman who had commanded rooms with stories and beaten everyone at cards was mostly gone, replaced by someone he barely recognized. He sat with her anyway, held her hand, tried to communicate through presence what words could no longer convey.</p>

            <p>That night, she came to him in his dreams. Not a vague impression or symbolic visitation, but a real moment experienced with complete clarity—Me-Mom as she had been, sharp and present, saying what needed to be said in the way dreams sometimes allow when waking reality has closed those channels. The experience felt more substantial than mere dreaming, more intentional than his subconscious creating comfort.</p>

            <p>When he woke, his mother was there with the news. Me-Mom had passed during the night.</p>

            <p>The timing was too precise to dismiss, too aligned to be coincidence. She had waited for his return from Pennsylvania, held on through weeks that should have taken her, and then—having seen him one final time, having reached him in the only way still available—she let go. It was characteristic of her, even in death, to find a way to communicate, to maintain connection, to offer what comfort she could to the boy she'd helped raise.</p>

            <p>The loss carved something out of him that would never fully heal. Along with one more visit with his biological father as the man he is now, there is nothing he wants more than time with Me-Mom. The questions he would ask now. The conversations they could have about war, about service, about the cost of patriotism and the complexity of national identity. About how to love a country while despising its divisions, how to honor sacrifice while questioning the purposes to which it's directed, how to maintain idealism in the face of relentless cynicism.</p>

            <p>But those conversations were lost with her passing, joining the accumulating category of might-have-beens that would define so much of his life. What remained was what she'd given him—a love of aviation, a fascination with unconventional warfare, an appreciation for storytelling and music and the kind of intellectual rigor that turned card games into strategic contests. And that final visitation, that dream-moment that felt like grace, like her last gift, like proof that some connections transcend the limitations of failing bodies and hospital rooms.</p>

            <p>The image that persisted wasn't of her in that hospital bed, diminished and incoherent. It was of that flag planted at the end of a quarter-mile driveway, recognizing effort, celebrating arrival, promising welcome. It was of her at the organ, music flowing effortlessly. It was of her at the card table, gin in hand, beating everyone with that sharp mind that never dulled until the very end. And it was of that dream, that final moment of clarity and connection, when she found a way to say goodbye.</p>

            <p>Me-Mom and Pop-pop had provided something his stepfather couldn't—models of adventurous competence, demonstrations that capability could persist despite limitation, proof that unconventional lives could be lived with dignity and purpose. They'd shown him that blindness didn't prevent precision work, that age didn't eliminate adventure, that intellect could be exercised through play, that home could be defined by open doors and constant conversation rather than walls and scheduled routines.</p>

            <p>Their influence would persist long after Me-Mom's death, long after the farmstead was sold and Pop-pop moved to managed care and the North Dakota chapter closed. In his fascination with aviation that would eventually lead to the FAA. In his attraction to special operations and elite military units. In his appreciation for classical music and strategic games. In his belief that patriotism could be something more nuanced than flag-waving, something earned through sacrifice but requiring constant interrogation, something that demanded both love and criticism, both service and skepticism.</p>
